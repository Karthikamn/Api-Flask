      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (libraries your code needs)
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: THE COMPILE STEP
      # This runs the 'build' script defined in your package.json
      - name: Compile/Build Project
        run: npm run build --if-present

      # Step 5: Save the result (The "Artifact")
      # This lets you download the compiled files after the robot finishes
